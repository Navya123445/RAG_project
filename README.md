RAG-Based Medical Chatbot
Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer medical questions. It leverages a combination of dense and sparse retrieval techniques to find relevant information from a corpus of medical textbooks and then uses a language model to generate a coherent answer. The user interface is built with Gradio, providing an easy way to interact with the chatbot.

Features
Hybrid Search: Utilizes both dense vector search (via Sentence Transformers) and sparse keyword search (via BM25) for robust document retrieval.

Vector Database: Employs Pinecone as a vector database to efficiently store and query document embeddings.

Language Model Integration: Uses the EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M model for text generation, making it accessible without requiring API keys for proprietary models.

Interactive UI: A simple and user-friendly web interface powered by Gradio.

Medical Corpus: The knowledge base is built from a collection of 18 medical textbooks.

Technologies Used
LangChain: For building the core RAG pipeline and integrating different components.

Pinecone: As the vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.

Hugging Face Transformers: For using pre-trained language models and sentence transformers.

Gradio: For creating the web-based user interface.

Sentence Transformers: For generating dense vector embeddings of the text data.

Pinecone-text: For sparse vector encoding using BM25.

Project Structure
The project is structured as a single Jupyter Notebook (Navya_RAG_LLM_TASK.ipynb) that contains all the steps from setting up the environment to launching the application. The key steps are:

Installation: Installs all the necessary Python libraries.

Pinecone Setup: Initializes the Pinecone vector database and creates an index.

Embedding and Sparse Encoders: Sets up the Hugging Face sentence transformer for dense embeddings and the BM25 encoder for sparse vectors.

Data Loading and Processing: Loads medical textbooks from Google Drive, processes them, generates embeddings, and upserts them into the Pinecone index.

LLM and QA Chain Setup: Initializes the GPT-Neo language model and creates a RetrievalQA chain using LangChain.

Gradio UI: Launches an interactive web interface for users to ask questions and get answers.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can then install the required libraries by running the following command:

pip install -qU \
    langchain==0.0.354 \
    langchain-community \
    openai==1.6.1 \
    pinecone-client==3.1.0 \
    tiktoken==0.5.2 \
    gradio==3.40.0 \
    pinecone \
    python-dotenv \
    sentence-transformers \
    pinecone-text \
    transformers \
    accelerate

Usage
Set up your environment:

Make sure you have a Pinecone API key.

Mount your Google Drive and ensure the path to the medical textbooks is correct.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially.

The notebook will handle the data loading, embedding, and setting up the QA chain.

Interact with the Chatbot:

The final cell in the notebook will launch a Gradio interface.

You can enter your medical questions in the input text box and receive answers generated by the RAG pipeline.

How It Works
Data Ingestion: The medical textbooks are loaded and chunked into smaller documents.

Embedding: Each document is converted into a dense vector embedding using a sentence transformer model.

Indexing: The embeddings and metadata are stored in a Pinecone index for efficient retrieval.

Retrieval: When a user asks a question, the retriever queries the Pinecone index to find the most relevant documents.

Generation: The retrieved documents are passed to the language model along with the original question. The model then generates a comprehensive answer based on the provided context.

Future Improvements
Use a more powerful LLM: While GPT-Neo is a good free alternative, using a more advanced model like GPT-3.5 or a fine-tuned open-source model could improve the quality of the generated answers.

Improve document chunking: Experiment with different chunking strategies to optimize the context provided to the LLM.

Fine-tune the retriever: Adjust the alpha parameter in the hybrid search to find the optimal balance between dense and sparse retrieval.

Deploy as a standalone application: Package the project as a standalone web application using a framework like Flask or FastAPI for easier deployment and access.
