Encephalitis, thrombocytopenia (a rare complication of postnatal infection). Congenital infection is associated with congenital anomalies. Roseola infantum HHV-6 Prodrome: Acute onset of high fever (> 40°C); no other symptoms for 3–4 days. Rash: A maculopapular rash appears as fever breaks (begins on the trunk and quickly spreads to the face and extremities) and often lasts < 24 hours. Febrile seizures may occur as a result of rapid fever onset. Varicella Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) Prodrome: Mild fever, anorexia, and malaise precede the rash by 24 hours. Rash: Generalized, pruritic, “teardrop” vesicular periphery; lesions are often at different stages of healing. Infectious from 24 hours before eruption until lesions crust over. Progressive varicella with meningoencephalitis and hepatitis occurs in immunocompromised children. Congenital infection is associated with congenital anomalies.

Virchow was certainly correct in asserting that disease originates at the cellular level, but we now realize that cellular disturbances arise from alterations in molecules (genes, proteins, and others) that influence the survival and behavior of cells. Thus, the foundation of modern pathology is understanding the cellular and molecular abnormalities that give rise to diseases. It is helpful to consider these abnormalities in the context of normal cellular structure and function, which is the theme of this introductory chapter.\n",
